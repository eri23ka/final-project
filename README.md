cse210-Final Project
Title: Space Impact

Description
Space Impact is game where the Jetfighter tries to eliminate the approaching enemies. There are two types of enemies, the red ones which when they cross the boundary, they aren't harmful, however, the second ones, when they cross the boundaries, then the game is over. The jetfighter bullets should hit the head of the approaching enemy to destroy the enemy or to get points. The game requires precise targeting. The keys for moving the Jetfighter are W for up movement and S for down movement. The space bar is used to move the release the bullet points. So you play the game by moving the W key on keyboard to move the Jetfighter up while hitting the space bar to realse the bullets. You use the S key to move the jetfighter down while still hitting the space bar to release the bullets. When the bullet hits the red approaching enemy, the points are doubled compared to hiting the usual enemy.When the pink enemy is hit, 5 points is added to the player/jetfighter/score. Once the normal enemy crosses the border, the game is over message is diplayed and the cycle turns white. The red enemy continues passing but shooting them won't work as the game is over.
